Income Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project was developed as part of the Break Through Tech Program in collaboration with eCornell. Over nine weeks, I explored machine learning, deep learning, and neural networks to solve real-world problems.

The final portfolio project focuses on predicting individual income levels based on census demographic data, leveraging Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebooks, ensemble learning techniques, hyperparameter tuning, and cross-validation to achieve robust performance.

Dataset
Source: Census Income Dataset

Features: Demographic and employment attributes (age, education, occupation, educational number)

Target: Income level (>50K or â‰¤50K)

Models and Methods
Random Forest Classifier (best performer)

Decision Trees

Stacking Classifier (ensemble approach)

Data preprocessing and feature engineering

Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV 

k-Fold Cross-Validation for performance validation

Data visualization using matplotlib and seaborn

Results
Random Forest achieved 80% accuracy

Precision and recall were approximately 75%

Stacking classifier provided similar performance with improved generalization

Feature importance analysis identified key demographic predictors

Future Improvements
Experiment with Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and LightGBM

Further optimize hyperparameters

Deploy model as a REST API or interactive dashboard
